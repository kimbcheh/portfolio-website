    <p>
     Hi I'm Kimberly! I'm a detail-oriented professional looking to pivot into
     software development. I have undertaken self-directed learning in various
     front-end languages and tools and am focused on continually improving my
     skills.
    </p>
    <p>
     From my previous work experience, I bring analytical thinking,
     problem-solving skills and clear communication to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     On a more personal note, I'm a huge fan of good design and coffee! &#9749;
    </p>
    <p>
     Some technology I've worked with...
     <ul>
      <li>LANGUAGES: HTML5, CSS3 AND JAVASCRIPT ES6</li>
      <li>FRAMEWORKS: REACT</li>
      <li>
       OTHER: VERSION CONTROL, RESTFUL API, CSS FRAMEWORKS, SASS AND FIGMA
      </li>
     </ul>
